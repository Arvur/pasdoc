# These are FPC-specific options for compiling pasdoc.
# Path options (-Fu, -Fi) are not specified here -- they are specified only

# What are the reasons for maintaining this cfg file
# (as opposed to dropping this cfg file and specifying all compilation options
# in the Makefile) ?
#
# 1. This looks a little clearer than typing these options in the Makefile ?
#
# 2. Using #IFDEF AMIGA below. Although Amiga is not actually supported
#    target now.
#
# In the future, this file may be removed and everything will be handled
# only inside the Makefile.
