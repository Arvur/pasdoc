- Default value of EditHtmlBrowserCommand.Text
  should be read from some user's config file.

  Also this should allow executing "default shell association"
  for HTML under Win32, using ShellExecute.
  Maybe using rundll instead of coding it ?
  Under UNIXes the equivalent is already available, just use `run-mailcap'.

- Layout of controls is not controlled as good as it should be.
  You may encounter problems if you use unusually large fonts etc.
  This is partially because of lame (nonexistent?) Delphi positioning
  scheme, partially because of problems with keeping such things
  portable in Lazarus (across GTK and Win32 component sets).

  It's a shame for me, but for now each time I switched between
  GTK and Win32 I found that I have to readjust layout of some things
  a little... Hopefully these issues are now gone and layout looks good
  for everyone, but I'm not happy with it, really.

- pasdoc_gui should allow user to configure default state of "Defines".
  Actually, it should allow user to configure default state of *all* options.
  E.g. maybe someone always wants to make default language of docs = Polish ?
  Maybe someone wants default verbosity = 6 ?
  Maybe someone has some include directory with his include files that
  he wants to always be added to "Include dirs" by default ?
  This can all be very nicely solved by storing some "default project settings"
  in user's directory and loading it on program start (and menu "New" execution).
  Then the code that currently loads contents from Ini file can be modified
  to actually have really good default values, and instead of using "SetDefaults"
  we simply load from a file where "default project settings" for this user
  are stored (like ~/.pasdoc_gui/default.pds on Unixes)
