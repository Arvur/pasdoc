In this directory you should be able to find packages that allow you
to install PasDoc components in Lazarus and Delphi IDE.

For Delphi the intention is that we will provide packages
for these Delphi versions that are available to us.
No other long-term promise can be made.
Note that Kylix packages are in delphi/linux/ subdirectory,
there is no kylix/ subdirectory.

For Lazarus the intention is that we will provide packages
just for latest version of Lazarus. There should be no reason
to provide separate packages for different Lazarus versions.

Package name is "pasdoc_package", not just "pasdoc", to avoid
any name conflicts with unit PasDoc.pas and the pasdoc program.
Version of the package reflects version stored in PASDOC_VERSION
constant in PasDoc unit.
