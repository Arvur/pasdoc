In this directory you should be able to find packages that allow you
to install PasDoc components in Lazarus and Delphi IDE.

For Delphi package files may be specific to platform (Linux or Windows)
and Delphi version. Note that Kylix packages are in delphi/linux/
subdirectory, there is no kylix/ subdirectory.

For Lazarus we will provide packages just for latest version of Lazarus.
There should be no reason to provide separate packages for different
Lazarus versions, after all Lazarus is free and you can always upgrade it.
Great advantage of Lazarus packages is that they are not tied to
a particular platform, so there is no need to maintain different
package files for different platforms.

Package name is "pasdoc_package", not just "pasdoc", to avoid
any name conflicts with unit PasDoc.pas and the pasdoc program.
Version of the package reflects version stored in PASDOC_VERSION
constant in PasDoc unit.
