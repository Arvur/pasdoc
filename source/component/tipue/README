This directory contains some files from tipue, version 1.63, slightly modified.

These files are processed by programs file_to_pascal_string and
file_to_pascal_data (in ../../tools/)
and then their contents are included in PasDoc_Tipue unit.
So all needed tipue data is compiled inside pasdoc binary.
This way you don't have to download and unpack tipue to use it with pasdoc.
When pasdoc will be able to automatically generate tipue index data,
users will not have to do (or even know) *anything* about tipue at all
to use it with pasdoc. It will be just a matter of passing --use-tipue-search
(we can't use tipue by default, without explicit request by --use-tipue-search
option, since it's not suitable for really large documentation,
see [http://pasdoc.sipsolutions.net/UseTipueSearchOption]).

With my first try at integrating tipue with pasdoc, I made an option
--use-tipue-search=/path/where/tipue/was/unpacked/ and then in pasdoc
I was copying scripts from tipue (with some processing in the middle).
But it turned out that there are a few modifications to tipue files
that I would like to do, so, since tipue scripts are very small,
I realized that just including "fixed" tipue version compiled inside
pasdoc may be better solution.

In the future the best option would be to make some installers/packages
for pasdoc and put tipue files for pasdoc in some directory that pasdoc
knows about. This would remove the necessity to keep everything in one
binary file, as we could handle nicely the fact that pasdoc always
installs some additional external files for itself.
For now, embedding these files in pasdoc binary seems the simplest option
for users.

Modifications to tipue scripts:

tip_form.js:
  results_location = "results.html";
  -> results_location = "_tipue_results.html";

  window.location = results_location;
  -> parent.content.location.href = results_location;
  (makes results appear in our "content" frame, see [http://www.tipue.com/kb/a0003.html])

tip_search.js
  results_location = "results.html";
  -> results_location = "_tipue_results.html";

_tipue_results.html (based on results.html example page in tipue sources)

  Our results page is named "_tipue_results.html",
  instead of standard "results.html".
  This avoids problems where user could have a unit named "Results".

  Modifications:
  * excessive css removed
    (let's be more usable instead of looking "cool" without any purpose)
  * we open external links with target="_parent"
  * removed <form> to search from results page
    (since our search form is visible all the time in navigation frame,
    so it's needless/confusing to show second "Search" edit box and button
    that do the same thing)
  * links to png version of the logo

tipue_b1.png
  This is converted to png version of tipue_b1.gif
  (Why ? Because I prefer png :). But it's also 3 times smaler.)
