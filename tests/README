Test units for pasdoc.

The goal of these units is to be short and difficult for pasdoc.
"Difficult" usually means that pasdoc failed to handle them correctly
at some time, i.e. most of these units are test cases of some pasdoc's bugs.

--------------------
Naming of Pascal unit files in this directory:

ok_*
  Means that this unit should be parsed by pasdoc without any warnings.

warning_*
  Means that this unit should be parsed by pasdoc (i.e. some documentation
  for it should be generated), but some warnings should be reported
  by pasdoc.

error_*
  Means that pasdoc should not be able to parse this unit,
  documentation for this unit shouldn't be possible to generate.
  pasdoc should generate proper error message for this case.

  Note that pasdoc may report errors as warnings,
  e.g. "Warning[2]: Error EPasDoc: error_line_number.pas(26):
  could not open include file not_existing.inc ..."
  Pasdoc calls this a warning, since, after all, it can continue
  it's work by simply skipping to the next unit.
  But for the sake of this distinction, this is an *error*,
  not merely a *warning*.
  The precise difference between an error and a warning is:
  "error makes impossible to generate documentation for this unit".

Units are divided into these 3 groups because
-- These groups are precisely defined, so there shouldn't be any concern
   about "where this test unit belong".
-- We should be eventually able to use output messages and exit status
   of pasdoc to automate testing as much as we can.

Notes:
-- Please keep prefixes "ok_", "warning_", "error_" lowercase so that
   e.g. the file-mask `ok_*' works as expected on case-sensitive file-systems.
   Try to follow the convention 
   "prefix_description_of_test_lowercase_with_underscores.pas".
-- Most of these units will have empty implementation.
   They are not supposed to be ever compiled by anything.
-- There is no requirement here that the interface of units
   placed here must be correct Pascal code.
   Pasdoc should be able to handle even incorrect units.
   Usually it should break with some parsing error on such units,
   but it doesn't have to (after all, pasdoc is not meant to
   exactly reimplement some part of a compiler that carefully checks
   syntax and everything), it may try to generate some docs.
   But even with incorrect units, it obviously shouldn't fail with some
   miserable error (like sigsegv :) or do anything that it shouldn't,
   like removing some files or so.

--------------------
Possible tests to be done:

1. make PAS=ok_*.pas
   make PAS=warning_*.pas
   make PAS=error_*.pas

   and each time check manually pasdoc's output and generated docs.

   Default output is html, you may/should also try other output
   formats, e.g. pdf, like
     make pdf PAS=ok_*.pas
     make pdf PAS=warning_*.pas
     make pdf PAS=error_*.pas

   These are not any automated tests, so you must look at units'
   sources and comments there to know what generated documentation should
   look like (in case of ok_* and warning_* files) and what
   warnings/errors should be reported (in case of warning_* and error_* files).

   Of course, just briefly checking that all ok_* units generate no warnings,
   all warning_* units generate some warnings (and produce some docs)
   and all error_* units generate errors (and no docs)
   is still a better test than nothing...

2. "Correct tests output" try to give more automated way to exactly
   check documentation of test units here.
   We maintain on [http://pasdoc.sourceforge.net/correct_tests_output/]
   something that we call "correct output of tests".

   Everyone can download them simply by entering scripts/ directory
   and executing
     ./download_correct_tests_output.sh html
   where you can replace `html' with any pasdoc's output format name.
   See documentation inside scripts/download_correct_tests_output.sh
   for more detailed docs.

   Then whenever you want you can compare current documentation generated
   by pasdoc to downloaded "correct output"
   e.g. using `diff -u html/ correct_output/html/'.

   Note that *failure* of comparison does not necessarily mean that
   current pasdoc *has* a bug, since it's possible that current output of
   pasdoc is different (because e.g. we improved and changed something)
   but still correct.
   Also *success* of comparison does not mean that current pasdoc does
   *not* have a bug, because this "current output" was just
   accepted at some point by human as "correct".
   Also it checks only generated documentation,
   does not check pasdoc's output on stdout when generating,
   so it doesn't test whether pasdoc prints correct warnings/errors.
   So, this is unfortunately no ultimate test.

   Hmmm, I may as well put here a link to mail with my concerns
   (and read also Thomas answers!) about this:
   [http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=11427925].
   In short: this technique of checking will be successful
   if pasdoc's output will not change very often.

   If pasdoc's developer sees at any point that "current output" differs
   from "correct output" and also he carefully checked that "current
   output" is still correct, than he should upload his "current output"
   as new "correct output" by entering scripts/ directory and executing
     ./uplad_correct_tests_output.sh html username
   See documentation inside scripts/upload_correct_tests_output.sh
   for more detailed docs. Note that before uploading you should
   be relatively sure that you compared against most recent version
   of "correct output", to save yourself trouble of unnecessary
   uploading.

   Beware that script `upload_correct_tests_output.sh format ...'
   will upload everything that you will have inside subdirectory
   of given format. This is painful in case of output like LaTeX,
   where you can accidentally upload files like docs.pdf or docs.dvi
   (that shouldn't be uploaded).
   In this case you can do something like `make clean latex' before
   uploading to be sure that you upload only "docs.tex" file.

3. make html validate_html

   This is an automatic test that makes html docs for all test units
   and validates them using sgml validator.
   onsgmls program must be installed for this to work.

   Links how to install onsgmls may be found here
   [http://pasdoc.sourceforge.net/phpwiki/index.php/HtmlOutput].

4. cd scripts/
   ./check_cache.sh html
   ./check_cache.sh latex

   $1 arg for this script is required and is any valid pasdoc format
   (as for pasdoc's --format option).
   Rest of args are just passed to pasdoc as they are.

   This runs pasdoc twice using the cache,
   1st time the cache directory is empty and pasdoc writes the cache,
   2nd time pasdoc should read everything from the cache.
   The script then checks that pasdoc's output was identical each time
   (comparing them with `diff -u', so you get diff on output if something
   does not match).

   This somehow checks that writing the cache and reading the cache
   and writing documentation basing on information obtained from the cache
   (instead of from parsing units) works OK.

   Everything is read/written to a temporary directory scripts/check_cache_tmp/,
   that is removed at the beginning and at the end of the script.
   (It's removed at the beginning, and also by `make clean', just to
   make sure that no garbage is left there, in case script failed
   for whatever reason.)
   So this script is mostly independent from the rest of the tests
   here -- it just happens to use the same test units.

   In case comparison between two outputs failed both outputs
   and left in scripts/check_cache_tmp/, so developer can inspect
   them closer.

--------------------
Random notes:

Remember that you can always override at command-line what test units
are used, e.g.
  make html PAS=ok_*.pas
or
  make html PAS=todo/ok_*.pas
or
  make html PAS=ok_expanding_descriptions.pas
Default value is *.pas, i.e. all test units in this directory
(but not in todo/ subdirectory).

`make clean' will clean this directory.

Note that make used must be GNU make.
Under Linux this is standard, under FreeBSD this is called `gmake',
under Win32 you can get this with cygwin ([http://www.cygwin.com/]).

scripts/ subdirectory contains some helpful things for running tests.
These should be scripts that perform some additional tests
on test units available here (like check_cache.sh),
but also some helper scripts/files for Makefile in this directory.

--------------------
Subdirectory todo/

It contains units that are known to
be incorrectly handled by pasdoc by now. "Incorrectly handled"
may mean that generated documentation is incorrect, or that pasdoc
fails with some error on correct input, but "incorrectly handled"
may also mean that pasdoc fails to write a proper warning/error
in case when input (unit's sources) is obviously wrong.

Files inside todo/ should follow exactly the same naming convention
as units in this directory (ok_*, warning_*, error_*).
In this case, unit's name tells what pasdoc *should* do with such unit,
even if it doesn't do it for now.
The idea is that when developer fixes a problem with some unit
in tests/todo/ directory, he can simply move this unit to tests/.

(Note: moving files inside CVS is problematic (you know, it's actually
`cvs remove' + `cvs add' and this does not move cvs log info),
but I don't think that accurate cvs log info for test
units is so much important to worry about it.)

These files are in separate todo/ subdirectory, because otherwise
every time we would like to check our tests we would have to
remember "oh, such-and-such test fails but it's a known problem,
so I can ignore it". This would be troublesome,
because *usually* we will want to test whether we did not break
anything that previously worked, and we will not care that there
are still some unresolved problems in pasdoc.

And that's all for now.
